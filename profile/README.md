# Bioinformatics Seragnoli

**Open‑source bioinformatics for precision haematology, Institute of Hematology "L.&& A. Seràgnoli", Bologna.**

We build and maintain computational pipelines and R packages that turn large‑scale sequencing data into clinically useful insight, especially for plasma‑cell disorders such as Multiple Myeloma.

## 🔬 What we do

| Project | Description | Tech / Links |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **BOBaFIT** | Bioconductor R package that refits and recalibrates baseline copy‑number profiles via unsupervised clustering. | R package · [Bioconductor release page](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BOBaFIT.html) | :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| **CloEvoScore** | Shiny app + Docker pipeline to reconstruct clonal evolutionary trajectories and derive evolution scores from gene‑level copy numbers. | Shiny, R, Docker | :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |
| **GenoMed_MM** | Snakemake workflow for classifying clonal copy‑number alterations from ultra‑low‑pass WGS of multiple‑myeloma samples (GenoMed4All WP T5.2). | Snakemake, Singularity, Bash, R | :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |

> **Looking for documentation?** Each repository ships its own detailed README, example data and, where relevant, a research preprint or publication.
